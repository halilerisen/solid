# Liskov Substitution Principle

The Liskov substitution principle (LSP) is particular definition of a subtyping relation, called strong behavioral subtyping, that was initially introduced by Barbara Liskov in a 1988 conference keynote address titled Data abstraction and hierarch. It is based on the concept of "substitutability" - a principle in object-oriented programing stating that an object (such as a class) and a sub-object (Such as as class that extends the first class) must be interchangeable without breaking the program.

Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) states that **object of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without breaking the application.**. In the words, what we want is to have the objects of our subclasses behaving the same was as the objects of our superclass.
