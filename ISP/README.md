# Interface Segregation Principle

Interface segregation principle (ISP) states that no code should be forced to depend on method it does not use. IPS splits interfaces that are very large into smaller and more specific ones so that clients will only have to know about the methods that are of interest to them. Such shrunken interfaces are also called role interfaces. ISP is intended to keep a system decoupled and thus easier to refactor, change and redeploy.
